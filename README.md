# MasterPlan
## Context
With the continued rising case of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a trend for people to work from home more often. However, those who only works from home can suffer major psychological and physical costs. 

 

According to the analysis conducted by Deloitte on the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and wellbeing, based on a survey of 1,248 UK workers, it was discovered that

- 38% of workers has experienced a negative impact on their wellbeing because of lockdown

- 45% of the worker misses the social interaction of F2F work when working from home

- 25% of the worker appreciates the easiness of networking when in the office compared to working from home

- After lockdown, 61% of desk-based workers would prefer to work from home more often

 

According to black dog institute, some common experiences of working from home are

- feeling isolated, lonely, and disconnected from other people

- being unable to ‘switch off from work’

- reduced boundaries between work and personal life

- having difficulty staying motivated

- having difficulty prioritising workload

- feeling uncertainty about your productivity

- feeling guilty about not performing work or family duties as well as usual

 

We can see from the statistics provided above that although working from home could bring about negative impacts on workers, a majority of the population would like to work from home more often even after lockdown. For companies to generate more satisfaction from their employees, an essential question arises: 

**How can technical solutions be utilised to combat the negative impact of working from home?** 



## Scope
To combat the issue mentioned in the context, some suggestions are provided by black dog institute, which includes

- Set up routine and structure, create boundaries between ‘work time’ and ‘home time’

- Stay connected with co-workers and your manager by scheduling regular virtual or phone meetings

- Try a digital detox in the evenings

- Try and get outside at least once a day

- Focus on silver linings

 

Therefore, we can see that a productivity app that assist users with organising their days and providing reminders for incorporating different activities in their day could be a potentially helpful way to improve the mental health of those who are working from home. This gives rise to our 3 main statements

- I want to be able to organise my day in a productive and efficient manner so I can feel a sense of achievement upon finishing up my day

- I want to be able to stay connected with my social circle with minimal effort so I can suffer less from social isolation

- I want to be reminded about the great things that happen throughout the day so I can feel the positivity from my life
